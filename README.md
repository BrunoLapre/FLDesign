This is a collection of smart contracts and associated components to help organise an off-chain FL system. Utilizes Tasks as registering the participants and the active task, and uses both ERC20 and ERC1155 tokens as reward tokens and model access tokenization respectively as rewards for contributions.

Please note the contracts are implemented as proof of concepts and are not currently suitable for deployment. Additionally, I definitely broke something pre-version control so the initial commit doesn't work fully as intended.
